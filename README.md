Hi. I'm Matt. My life right now involves (amongst other things): product management, reading a lot, writing sometimes, maintaining my newsletter, researching motion-based approaches to computing and intelligence, and studying governance with the Yak Collective.

My past life includes (amongst other things): multiple sports as a child and teenager, nope-ing out of formal higher education, itinerant restaurant and bar employment, movement coaching, stints in security response teams at summer events and festivals, independent writing projects (non-fiction and fiction) and high-volume blogging, freelance editorial services, operative work at a factory, and a pandemic-induced pivot into tech.

## Contact

The simplest way to reach me is email: *matt@thisdomain*. I use email predominantly for correspondence, instead of capture. I'm on Farcaster ([fcast.me/msms](https://fcast.me/msms)) and Twitter ([@Matthew_Sweet](https://twitter.com/Matthew_Sweet)), too. I'm responsive by default and operate by [Crocker's Rules](http://sl4.org/crocker.html).
