## About

Hi, I'm Matt. My life right now involves (amongst other things) product management, producing a weekly newsletter, and thinking about the intersection of complex systems, computing and communication. In past lives I was (amongst other things) a sporty kid, a mediocre student, a waiter and bartender, a movement coach, a security response team member, an independent writer, a freelance editor, and a factory worker.

## Contact

The simplest way to reach me is email: _matt@thisdomain_. I use email for correspondence, instead of capture. I’m on [Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz) (@msms) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Matthew_Sweet) (@Matthew_Sweet), too. I’m responsive by default and I operate by [Crocker’s Rules](http://sl4.org/crocker.html). Some reasons to contact me: to talk about something _I've_ read, wrote, built or thought about; to talk about something _you've_ read, wrote, built or thought about; to discuss problems or opportunities at the intersection of complex systems, computing and communication; to say hi.
