# Matthew Sweet

Hi, I'm Matt.

My life right now involves (amongst other things): product management at a B2B startup, reading a lot, writing ()infrequently, maintaining ()Mag7, researching ()motion-based approaches to computing and intelligence, thinking about ()governance with other ()Yaks, and ()Farcasting.

My past life includes (amongst other things): multiple sports as a child and teenager, nope-ing out of formal higher education, itinerant restaurant and bar employment, movement coaching, stints in security response teams at summer events and festivals, independent writing projects (non-fiction and fiction), freelance editorial work, operative work at a technical fabrics factory, and a pandemic-induced pivot into tech.

## Contact

The simplest way to reach me is email: (i)matt@thisdomain. I use email predominantly for ()correspondence, instead of capture. I'm on Farcaster () and Twitter (), too. I'm responsive ()by default and do my damndest to operate by ()Crocker's Rules.

## Now

A select view of what I'm currently up to.

- Going deep into product management
- Maintaining the ()Magnificent Seven, a weekly newsletter of notable artefacts
- Studying ()governance—how collectives form, coordinate and evolve—with some ()Yaks
- Researching motion-based approaches to computing and intelligence
- Trying to write more (()at Swell and Cut) and post more (()at Farcaster)

## Next

Some options for the near-future (>3 months and <2 years).

- Switch motion studies into production/synthesis mode
- Get back to fiction (traditional format or something hybrid/weirder)
- Tinker with low-level tech
- Collaborate on a project within the Yak Collective

## Later

Some possibilities for the far-future (>5 years).

- Learn a non-native language
- Learn to play an instrument
- Experiment with indie consulting
- Complete a long-haul bikepacking expedition
- Start something (either modest or unreasonably ambitious in character)
