Hi. I'm Matt. My life right now involves (amongst other things): product management, reading, writing, producing a newsletter, researching motion-based approaches to computing and intelligence, and contributing to a governance study group.

My past life includes (amongst other things): multiple sports as a child and teenager, nope-ing out of formal higher education, itinerant restaurant and bar employment, movement coaching, stints in security response teams at summer events and festivals, independent writing projects and high-volume blogging, freelance editorial services, factory work, and a pandemic-enabled pivot into tech.
